This is solely for me to study for AWS certification. Not to be distributed.

## What is Cloud Computing?
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s definition...<br>
5 essential characteristics:
1. On-demand self-service: "...can provision capabilities as needed *without requiring human interaction*"
2. Broad network access: "Capabilities are available over the *network* and accessed through *standard mechanisms*..."
3. Resource pooling: "There is a sense of *location independence*... no *control* or *knowledge* over the exact *location* of the resources" / "... Resources are *pooled* to serve multiple consumers using a *multi-tenant model*"
4. Rapid elasticity: "Capabilities can be *elastically provisioned* and *released* to scale *rapidly* outward and inward with demand." / "To the consumer, the capabilites available for provisioning ofen *appear* to be *unlimited*"
5. Measured service: "resource usage can be *monitored*, *controlled*, *reported*...AND *BILLED*"

## Public vs Private vs Multi vs Hyrbrid Cloud
- **Public**: using 1 public cloud <br>
AWS or Azure or Google Cloud 
- **Private**: using on-premises *real* cloud <br>
meeting the 5 essential characteristics 
- **Multi**: using more than 1 public cloud <br>
deploy 1/2 in 1 public cloud & half in the other || use 3rd party tool || etc.
- **Hybrid**: Public and Private cloud <br>
  - public + private of same vendor as 1 unified platform
  - *NOT* public cloud + legacy on-premises => (this means hybrid env or network)
